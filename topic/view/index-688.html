<p><div class="elimuvideo"><div align="center" class="embed-responsive                                               embed-responsive-16by9"><video controls="" class="embed-responsive-item">                                              <source src="..\..\media\resources\What_is_a_human_right__1.mp4" type="video/mp4" style="border-color: white; border-radius: 10pt; border-width: 10px; border-style: solid; margin: 25px 0px; background-color: white;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video</source></video></div></div></p>
<p>Human rights are standards that allow all people to live with <strong>dignity, freedom, equality, justice</strong>, and <strong>peace.</strong></p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\Meaning_of_HR.jpg" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>Every person has these rights simply because they are human beings.</p>
<p>They are guaranteed to everyone without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status.</p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\HR_for_all.jpg" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>Human rights are essential to the full development of individuals and communities.</p>
<p>Many people view human rights as a set of moral principles that apply to everyone.</p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\Rights_of_a_child.jpg" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p><strong>Example of rights that apply to children</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human rights are also part of international law, contained in treaties and declarations that spell out specific rights that countries are required to uphold.</p>
<p>Countries often incorporate human rights in their own national, state, and local&nbsp;laws.</p></p><p><h3>Characteristics of&nbsp;Human Rights&nbsp;</h3>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\Characteristics_HR.jpg" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p></p><p><p>Why are Human Rights Important?</p>
<p>Human rights reflect the minimum standards necessary for people to live with dignity.</p>
<p>Human rights give people the freedom to choose how they live, how they express themselves, and what kind of government they want to support, among many other things.</p>
<p>Human rights also guarantee people the means necessary to satisfy their basic needs, such as food, housing, and education, so they can take full advantage of all opportunities.</p>
<p>Finally, by guaranteeing life, liberty, equality, and security, human rights protect people against abuse by those who are more powerful.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, human rights: <strong><em>&ldquo;Ensure that a human being will be able to fully develop and use human qualities such as intelligence, talent, and conscience and satisfy his or her spiritual and other needs."</em></strong></p></p><p><h4>Where do Human Rights come from?</h4>

<p>The modern human rights era can be traced to struggles to end slavery, genocide, discrimination, and government oppression.</p>
<p>Atrocities during World War II made clear that previous efforts to protect individual rights from government violations were inadequate.</p>
<p>Thus was born the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as part of the emergence of the United Nations (UN).<br> <br> The UDHR was the first international document that spelled out the &ldquo;basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights that all human beings should enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The declaration was ratified without opposition by the UN General <br>Assembly on December 10, 1948.</p>
<p>When it was adopted, the UDHR carried great moral weight.</p>
<p>In order to give the human rights listed in the UDHR the force of law, the UN drafted two treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</p>
<p>Together, the UDHR, ICCPR, and ICESCR are known as the International Bill of Human Rights. They contain a comprehensive list of human rights that governments must respect, protect, and fulfill.</p></p><p><h4>Who is Responsible for Upholding Human Rights?</h4>
<p>Under human rights treaties, governments have the primary responsibility for protecting and promoting human rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, governments are not solely responsible for ensuring human rights.&nbsp; The UDHR states: <em>&ldquo;Every individual and every organ of society &hellip; shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This provision means that not only the government, but also businesses, civil society, and individuals are responsible for promoting and respecting human rights.</p>
<p>When a government ratifies a human rights treaty, it assumes a legal obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill the rights contained in the treaty.</p>
<p>Governments are obligated to make sure that human rights are protected by both preventing human rights violations against people within their territories and providing effective remedies for those whose rights are violated.&nbsp;</p></p><p><h4>What is my role?</h4>
<p>Governments are not the only ones responsible for upholding human rights. The UDHR states:</p>
<p><em>Every individual and every organ of society &hellip; shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance.</em></p>
<p>This means that not only the government, but also businesses, civil society, and individuals are responsible for promoting and respecting human rights. As individuals we are both rights-holders and duty-bearers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that we have both the right to be treated equally in dignity and justice, and also have the responsibility to treat others this way.</p></p><p><h4>The 30 articles of the universal declaration of human rights</h4>
<p>Declaration adopted by the&nbsp;in United Nations General Assembly 1948. Drafted by a committee chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt , it was adopted without dissent but with eight abstentions. Among its 30 articles are definitions of civil and political rights (including the rights to life, liberty, and a fair trial) as well as definitions of economic, social, and cultural rights (including the right to social security and to participation in the cultural life of one's community), all of which are owed by UN member states to those under their jurisdiction. It has acquired more juridical status than originally intended and has been widely used, even by national courts, as a means of judging compliance with member states' human-rights obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This video summarizes the 30 articles</em></p>

We all have the right to our own way of life and to enjoy the good things that art, science and learning bring.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>28. A Fair and Free World.</strong>&nbsp;There must be proper order so we can all enjoy rights and freedoms in our own country and all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
