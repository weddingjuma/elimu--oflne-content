				<p><p>Urbanisation refers to the development of towns. It also refers to an increase in the number of people living in urban areas. The smallest urban centres are very many in number while large towns or cities are very few and far apart.</p></p><p><h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Factors favouring the growth of towns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Presence of a natural harbour may lead to the development of a port.</li>
<li>Presence of farming activities which may lead to the development of collecting centres.</li>
<li>Presence of suitable climate, relief or well developed soial amenities like hospitals encourage people to settle.</li>
<li>Government policy or industrial activity.</li>
<li>Well developed transport and communication facilities.</li>
</ul></p><p><p>This map shows the location of some of the major towns in Kenya.</p>

<h4>Problems facing urban centres</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pollution: This includes water, air and noise pollution. Waste being dumped and littered from domestic houses and industries pollutes our environment.</li>
<li>Rural&ndash;urban migration: This has led to overcrowding in urban centres. Overcrowding may lead to an out break of disease.</li>
<li>Decline in morals resulting from an increase in crime and in prostitution as well as drug use.</li>
<li>Traffic jam caused by congestion.</li>
<li>Shortage of water and other resources due to too many people migrating to towns.</li>
<li>Unemployment which may lead to an increase in crime</li>
<li>Inadequate facilities due to high numbers of people moving to towns.</li>
<li>An increase in homelessness leading to street families.</li>
<li>An increase in slums, leading to a higher number of the urban poor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Efforts being made to solve problems in Kenyan urban centres</h4>
<p>1. The government is encouraging investors to locate some industries in rural areas to attract people to work there.</p>
<p>2. Facilities and living standards in rural areas are being improved so that people can be attracted to live there.</p>
<p>3. Slum upgrading projects have been initiated, where good houses are built and slum dwellers moved to occupy them.</p>
<p>4. Local authorities are improving garbage collection and educating people on the importance of keeping the environment clean.</p>
<p>5. Charity homes are being set up for street families to discourage them from begging on the streets.</p>
<p>6. Improving street lighting and increasing police posts in order to reduce incidences of crime.</p></p><p><h3>Reasons for the rapid growth of towns in Africa</h3>
<p><strong>Trade</strong></p>
<p>This is the main reason for the growth of many towns in Africa. This happens when traders build commercial buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Industries</strong></p>
<p>When people move to areas with industries in search of job, their diverse needs, for example; housing, trade, communication, transport and hospitality lead to development of towns.</p>
<p><strong>Minerals</strong></p>
<p>mining sites attract people in search of jobs and trade quickly turning them into towns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> Administration services</strong></p>
<p>Districts, provincial and national headquarters attract people who need these services therefore, turning them into towns.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Road junctions, railway terminus and others quickly turn into towns. Areas with good transport and communication facilities quickly grow into urban centres.</p>
<p><strong>Political factors</strong></p>
<p>Political decisions to move capital cities and government headquarters have led to the development and growth of towns.</p></p>
