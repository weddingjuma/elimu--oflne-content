				<p><h3>Masaku</h3>
<p><strong>Masaku </strong>was a descendant of the famous long distance trader known as Kivoi who was a powerful leader of the Akamba people.</p>
<ul>
<li>He was a political leader, a medicine man and a prophet.</li>
<li>He was able to predict if his people were about to be attacked.</li>
<li>This made him prepare his army well in order to defeat the enemy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\masaku.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<ul>
<li>He also predicted the coming of the Europeans and the building of the railway line.</li>
<li>His home was near where the present Machakos town now stands.</li>
<li>The town and the district were named after him &lsquo;Masaku&rsquo;s place&rsquo; hence, <strong>Machakos.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="..\..\media\resources\machakos.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></strong></p></p><p><h3>Koitalel arap Samoei</h3>
<p>Koitalel arap Samoei Samoei was a powerful ruler of the <strong>Nandi</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\samoei.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>When the British were building the railway to Uganda, they encountered hostility from the Nandi who attacked the railway workers in their camps and stole steel rails and copper wires.</p>
<p>The British in turn took the Nandi&rsquo;s cattle, burnt their stores and made away with their food reserves.</p>
<p>In 1905, British troops led by Meinertzhagen</p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\meinert.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>were sent to Kenya and met with <strong>Koitalel arap Samoei. </strong></p>
<p>During the meeting, a fight broke out and Koitalel was killed.</p>
<p>Meinertzhagen said that he had killed Orkoiyot Koitalel in self-defence since he had threatened his life.</p>
<p>However, the Nandi claimed that it was the British officers who had started the trouble.</p></p><p><h3>Mekatilili Wa Menza</h3>
<p>Mekatilili Wa Menza was a political leader of the <strong>Giriama</strong> people.</p>
<p>She was also a medicine woman and a prophetess.</p>
<p>She led her people in resisting the British in 1913 when they wanted them to move out of their land in order to make way for white settlers.</p>
<p>However, the British crushed the resistance because they had superior weapons.</p>
<p>They then forced the Agiriama to make peace and sign treaties.</p>
<p>However, this did not work out.</p>
<p>In 1913, Mekatilili was arrested together with other leaders and sent to exile. Below are pictures of Mekatilili Wa Menza.</p>

<p>Before the Europeans colonised Africa, there were two main forms of government in place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Government. </strong>&nbsp;A <strong>centralised </strong>system of government where a single person like a king or chief was in full control.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\centralised_govt.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of such governments were found among the <em>Toro, Bunyoro, Ankole </em>and<em> Buganda</em> in Uganda, the <em>Wanga </em>in Kenya and the <em>Chagga </em>and <em>Wanyamwezi</em> in Tanzania.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Council of Elders.</strong> A group of people formed a <strong>council of elders </strong>which regulated the activities of the community.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\council_of_elders.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>&nbsp;Authority in this system was shared or distributed to more people within the community.</p>
<p>There was a lot of consultation between the elders before any major decision was made.</p>
<p>Communities like the Abagusii, <em>Ameru, Akamba, Mijikenda </em>and<em> Agikuyu</em> in Kenya had this system of government.</p></p><p><h4>Traditional governments have the following functions;</h4>
<ul>
<li>They defended the community against attacks from their enemies.</li>
<li>They settled disputes among community members.</li>
<li>They punished people who committed crimes or disobeyed community laws.</li>
<li>They administered the traditional laws.</li>
<li>They presided over religious and traditional ceremonies like initiation, thanks giving, and child naming ceremonies.</li>
</ul></p><p><h3>Abawanga</h3>
<p>The Abawanga are one of the many communities that make up the <em><strong>Abaluhyia</strong> </em>people that occupy most of the Western part of Kenya.</p>
<p>The Wanga Kingdom was made up of several clans living together.</p>
<p>The members of ruling clan were called <em><strong>Bashitsetse.</strong> </em></p>
<p>Their traditional ruler or king was called the <strong>Nabongo.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="..\..\media\resources\nabongo.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></strong></p>
<p>The Abawanga kingdom was founded by a king called Wanga whose headquarter was at the present day Mumias.</p>
<p>The king was advised by elders from his clan whom he appointed.</p>
<p>The largest important expansion of the Wanga kingdom was during the rule of Nabongo Mumia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><h4>Why Mumia became a successful king</h4>
<p>Mumia made friends with foreigners who came to the area, uncluding the British and Arabs. He was given <strong>arms</strong> by the British and Arab traders.</p>
<p>The people in his kingdom traded with the foreigners and became wealthy.</p>
<p>An image of Mumias&nbsp; and his soldiers.</p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\nabongo_army.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>He ensured that his people were united and so they could not be attacked by the neighbouring communities.</p>
<p>With the arms he received, he set up a strong army.</p>
<p>He was wealthy; therefore he could hire people from neighbouring communities to protect his kingdom.</p></p><p><h3>The Ameru</h3>
<p>The Ameru people are <strong>Bantu</strong> speakers who mainly live around Mt. Kenya in Eastern Province.</p>
<p>Before the coming of the Europeans, the community was organised into villages called Mwirega.</p>
<p>Each mwirega was headed by a leader known as <strong>Mugambi.</strong></p>
<p>The villages or groups of clans came together to form a larger village.</p>
<p>This larger unit was headed by a <strong>Council of Elders.</strong></p>
<p>In this larger unit, different age-sets took different leadership responsibilities. Some age-sets were trained to become warriors who then had the duty of defending the community against attacks by their enemies.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the Ameru dancers.</p>

<h4><strong>The Buganda's Origin</strong></h4>
<p>Before the coming of Europeans, <strong>Bunyoro-Kitara<img src="..\..\media\resources\kitara.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></strong> was the most powerful kingdom in the present day Uganda.</p>
<p>It had several states which included the kingdoms of <em>Buganda, Toro, Busoga, Ankole</em> and <em>Karagwe</em> as we know them today.</p>
<p>Soon some states became unhappy with the way in which they were being ruled. They begun to break away to form separate kingdoms.</p>
<p>Soon, the large Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom was divided into the smaller Buganda, Busoga, Ankole, Karagwe and Toro kingdoms.</p>

</ul></p><p><h4>System of government of the Buganda</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Buganda Kingdom was started by <strong>Kintu </strong>who lived near Mt. Elgon.</li>
<li>It is believed that the thirteen Buganda clans are made up of the descendants of the thirteen people who travelled with Kintu.</li>
<li>At the start, Buganda was a small state which was easy to rule.</li>
<li>It had a strong and organised army. This enabled it to conquer the neighbouring states.</li>
<li>It had strong leaders. They had no hereditary chiefs. All chiefs were appointed by the Kabaka and they had to respect him.</li>
<li>It had an organised system of government.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></p><p><h4>Reasons why the Buganda Kingdom rose to become powerful</h4>
<ul>
<li>It controlled the <strong>trading routes</strong> in the area, which made it wealthy and gave it <strong>access to superior weapons,</strong> from Arab traders, which Buganda's enemies did not have.</li>
<li>They were able to hire people from other communities to fight for them whenever it was necessary.</li>
<li>The area had a <strong>suitable climate</strong> and good soils. This ensured that the people had enough food to eat throughout the year.</li>
<li>There was plenty of fish from Lake Victoria. This provided <strong>enough food</strong> for the people in the kingdom. Therefore they were healthy.</li>
<li>They <strong>mined iron</strong> in the kingdom. This enabled them to make spears and arrowheads. This improved the strength of their army.</li>
<li>The Buganda Kingdom fell when Kabaka Mutesa I invited the British missionaries into the kingdom and decided to collaborate with them.</li>
</ul></p><p><h3>The Nyamwezi</h3>
<p>The Nyamwezi are a <strong>Bantu</strong> speaking community that lives in the Northern part of what is now Tanzania. They began to unite and became a strong in the 19th Century.</p>
<p><img src="..\..\media\resources\nyamwezi.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p><strong>How their government was organised</strong></p>
<p>The Nyamwezi lived in groups of villages called <strong>Gunguli </strong>which were headed by a hereditary chief known as <strong>Ntemi </strong>or <strong>Mutemi</strong>. Such chiefs were also found among other communities living in the North-West and Central parts of Tanzania.</p>
<p>The Ntemi or central ruler was assisted to rule by a <strong>Council of Elders </strong>called <strong>Wanyamhala</strong>. The Ntemi was also a military and religious leader. In spiritual matters, he was highly respected and regarded as a priest</p></p><p><h4>The main functions of the Ntemi<strong><br></strong></h4>
<p><strong><img src="..\..\media\resources\ntemi.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He was Commander-in-Chief of the army.</li>
<li>He ruled the chiefdom.</li>
<li>He made political decisions on behalf of the clan.</li>
<li>As a religious leader, he made sacrifices to the gods on behalf of the chiefdom. He was assisted by team of religious leaders called <strong>Wanyikulu</strong>.</li>
<li>He controlled trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Important Leaders</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minule</strong> He ensured that taxes were paid.</li>
<li><strong>Mganwe</strong> He carried out religious ceremonies and functions.</li>
<li><strong>Kikoma</strong> He was in charge of passing on news in the chiefdom.</li>
<li><strong>Mtwale</strong> He prepared the army for war.</li>
<li><strong>Mteko</strong> He acted as a spy and got information about enemies.</li>
</ul></p><p><h4>The Nyamwezi and Trade</h4>
<p>The Nyamwezi were famous in long distance trade and by the eighteenth century, the trade in the region was already well organised on the basis of clans.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, Arabs begun to trade with the Nyamwezi.</p>
<p>At about the same time, they were invaded by the Ngoni from the South.</p>
<p>It then became necessary to reorganise their empire and protect trade routes. The two Nyamwezi leaders who were able to do this were <strong>Mirambo </strong>and <strong>Nyungu ya Mawe</strong>.</p></p><p><h3>Mirambo</h3>
<p>Mirambo was captured by the Ngoni after they fought with the Nyamwezi.</p>
<p>An image of the Ngoni people<img src="..\..\media\resources\ngoni.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p>
<p>During his life in prison, he was able to learn new fighting skills and techniques from the Ngoni. After his release, he became the <strong>Chief of Uyowa Province.</strong></p>
<p>Mirambo was ambitious and wanted to extend his power and influence.</p>
<p>He begun recruiting soldiers and even paying some mercenary soldiers to increase the strength of his own army.</p>
<p>He then established his capital at <strong>Urambo</strong> which developed into a very important trading centre.</p>
<p>Mirambo&rsquo;s empire extended across the Arab caravan routes, which he was then able to control. He then imposed a tax on Arab traders to cross his territory.</p>
<p>This tax was a very important source of income for the empire.</p>
<p>When he died, his half-brother, Mpandasholo succeeded him but he was not very strong.</p>
<p>The empire then split again into small units and finally collapsed.</p>

<p>The Nyamwezi were long distant traders<img src="..\..\media\resources\long_distant_traders.png" style="border-color: white;                                   border-radius: 5pt; border-width: 5px;                                  border-style: solid; margin: 15px 0px;                                  background-color: white;"></p></p><p><h4>Nyungu ya Mawe</h4>
<p>Nyungu ya Mawe was another <strong>Nyamwezi</strong> leader who tried to unite the empire.</p>
<p>His area of control was located to the South of Mirambo&rsquo;s empire.</p>
<p>He also had a strong army and hired soldiers to increase the strength of his army.</p>
<p>He established a central system of government in his territory.</p>
<p>Each time he conquered a region, he put one of his men to be in charge.</p>
<p>These rulers were known as <strong>Mutwale </strong>or <strong>Vatwale </strong>(plural). He was the central ruler and had control over the whole territory.</p>
<p>Since the government of the empire was centralised, the Kingdom was able to survive even after the death of Nyungu ya Mawe.</p></p><p><h3>The decline of the Nyamwezi Empire</h3>
<p>Different chiefdoms within the empire often fought amongst themselves.</p>
<p>This weakened the empire.</p>
<p>There was no clear succession plan within the empire and both the maternal and paternal relatives claimed leadership to the throne.</p>
<p>The Ntemis were usually succeeded by the appointed officers although in some cases the throne was<strong> inherited</strong>.</p>
<p>Continual disputes between various leaders weakened the empire and its power declined.</p>
<p>The kingdom, however only came to an end when it was absorbed into the German East African Colony.</p>
